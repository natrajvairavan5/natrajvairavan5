### Hello! 👋 I'm Natraj Vairavan, a third-year UC Berkeley Economics & Statistics student who loves conducting data analysis to generate insights in finance and economic policy!

🐻 I'm a junior studying Economics and Statistics at UC Berkeley. I've worked on data analysis heavy projects with organizations such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Small Business Administration, and Change.org.

📖 I love reading economic, statistics, and machine learning research to learn more about the cutting-edge tools currently being developed!

🧠 I am proficient in statistical and probability theory, econometrics and causal inference, predictive machine learning, data pipelining, web-scraping, and more! I am currently trying to learn more about Bayesian statistics and NLP.

💬 I'd love to talk to anyone about data science and economics, especially on topics related to policy. Machine learning and NLP are tools I love to incorporate when conducting research!

📫 Feel free to reach out - I'd love to chat!
