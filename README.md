### Hello! 👋 I'm Natraj Vairavan, a third-year UC Berkeley Economics & Statistics student who loves conducting data analysis to generate insights in finance and economics!

🐻 I'm a junior studying Economics and Statistics at UC Berkeley. I've engaged in extensive data analysis projects with organizations such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Small Business Administration, and Change.org.

📖 I love reading economic, statistics, and machine learning research to learn more about the cutting-edge tools currently being developed! Currently, I'm working in two research areas: predictive economic time series algorithms and imbalanced machine learning classification without the use of synthetic data.

🧠 I am proficient in statistical and probability theory, econometrics and causal inference, predictive machine learning, data pipelining, web-scraping, and more! I am currently trying to learn more about Bayesian statistics and NLP.

💬 I'd love to talk to anyone about data science and economics, especially on topics related to policy. Machine learning, NLP, and other data science developments are increasingly being used in economic research, and so I'd be happy to have a discussion about this with you!

📫 Feel free to reach out - I'd love to chat!
